## Marketing Recommendations

### Targeting Strategy

**Priority 1 - Behavioral Targeting**:
- Use visit frequency data if available
- Target existing customers first
- 4+ visits/month = high-value segment

**Priority 2 - Demographic Filters**:
- Age: Focus on under-35
- Marital: Singles and partners over married
- Occupation: Professionals and students (for coffee)

**Priority 3 - Contextual Delivery**:
- Time: Morning for coffee, evening for bars
- Location: Near common routes, not urgent trips
- Passengers: Alone or with friends preferred

### Coupon Design

**Expiration Times**:
- Test 2-hour vs. 1-day expiration
- Hypothesis: Morning coffee = 2 hours, Evening bar = 1 day

**Messaging**:
- Bar: "Quick stop on your way home?"
- Coffee: "Grab your morning coffee!"
- Emphasize convenience, not discovery

### Budget Allocation

**High ROI Segments** (prioritize):
1. Frequent visitors during optimal times
2. Young professionals/students during commute
3. Solo drivers with no urgent destination

**Low ROI Segments** (deprioritize):
- New/infrequent visitors to category
- Parents with children in car
- During urgent trips (to home/work)

## Statistical Highlights

### Most Predictive Factors (in order)

**For Bar Coupons**:
1. Visit frequency (>3 times/month): +40% acceptance
2. Age (under 30): +25% acceptance
3. Passenger type (no kids): +20% acceptance
4. Marital status (not widowed): +15% acceptance

**For Coffee Coupons**:
1. Visit frequency (4+ times/month): +25% acceptance
2. Time of day (morning): +8% acceptance
3. Age (21-30): +7% acceptance
4. Passenger type (alone/friends): +11% acceptance

### Surprising Finding

**Income has low predictive power** for bar coupons! Frequent bar-goers accept regardless of income level. This suggests the behavior is more about lifestyle/social factors than affordability.

## Next Steps for Analysis

1. **Build predictive model**: Use logistic regression or random forest to predict acceptance probability
2. **AB test hypotheses**: Test optimal delivery times and expiration periods
3. **Segment deep-dives**: Analyze Restaurant(<$20), Restaurant($20-$50), and Carry-Out coupons
4. **Interaction effects**: Study how multiple factors combine (e.g., frequent visitor + morning + alone)
5. **ROI analysis**: Calculate expected return by segment to optimize spend
6. **Seasonality**: Incorporate weather and seasonal patterns
7. **Customer journey**: Map where in their route customers are most receptive

---

## Conclusion

Successful coupon campaigns should **target existing customers during their established routines**. Rather than trying to create new behaviors, focus on making it easier for people to do what they already do.

**The Golden Rule**: Right person (frequent visitor) + Right time (routine moment) + Right context (freedom to stop) = High acceptance rates

This approach can potentially **double coupon acceptance rates** compared to untargeted distribution.
